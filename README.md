### What I learned

This project helped me better understand and utilize Flexbox for creating responsive layouts. Flexbox was especially helpful in aligning items both horizontally and vertically while maintaining a clean, structured design. Here's an example of how Flexbox was used in the layout:  

```css
#social-links {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}
```  

Using `flex-direction: column` allowed the social links to stack vertically, while properties like `align-items` ensured consistent alignment across the container. This approach made it easy to adapt the design to different screen sizes and maintain an elegant structure.
